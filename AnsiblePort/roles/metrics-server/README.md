metrics-server 
=========

Currently unusable because it crashes as a result of using k8s v1.19


Example Playbook
----------------

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

    - hosts: servers
      roles:
         - metrics-server
